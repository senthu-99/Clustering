# Clustering

Analysis of Hiearchical vs K-Means Clustering on Seeds Dataset

Dataset
seeds_dataset.csv - Contains the data related to various seed features.
seeds_real.csv - Contains the correct clustering assignments for the seeds dataset.

Objectives:

1. K-means Clustering:

- Calculate the Weighted Kappa for K-means clustering at varying values of K compared to the correct clusters from seeds_real.csv.
- Use scatterplots to visualize clustering assignments for each K.

2. Hierarchical Clustering:

- Compare Hierarchical clustering results to the correct clusters using different linkage measures:
  Single
  Complete
  Average
- Illustrate the clusters using scatterplots.
- Showcase dendrograms for the respective linkage measures.

3. Visualize WK Results:

- Plot the Weighted Kappa values from both clustering techniques on a graph to understand their effectiveness.
